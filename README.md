Posting some interesting codes in this repo.
Check out the anti-ballistic missile where particle filters using the radars data (error added to replicate real life)
is used to predict the path of the upcoming missile and destroy it.

Latest addition is a 4 axis robotic arm simulation with path planning for travelling from one point to another

A-star algorithm implemented using matplotlib.pyplot
Predicting the position of a solar cleaning bot
